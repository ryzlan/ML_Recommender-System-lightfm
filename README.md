# ML_Recommender-System-lightfm
This is the code for the Recommender System challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #3' by @Sirajology on YouTube. The code uses the lightfm recommender system library to train a hybrid content-based + collaborative algorithm that uses the WARP loss function on the movielens dataset. The movielens dataset contains movies and ratings from over 1700 users. Once trained, our script prints out recommended movies for whatever users from the dataset that we choose to terminal.
